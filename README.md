# UWAdventure

UWAdventure is a console app, and eventual web app for simulating a bike store.  This app will be used in IS422 and IS424.

## Getting Started

This project is written in C# targetting .Net Framework 4.6.  You can either download the zip file, clone or fork the repository, depending on your familiarity with Git.

### Prerequisites

You need Visual Studio 2017 and access to SQL Server 2008 or newer.  

### Installing

Database scripts are located in the Database SQL folder to setup an initial schema in the database and preload with data.   You can also use the Azure database reference.  You will need to use GlobalProtect VPN in order to access the database from off-campus.   Instructions can be found here on the [Campus KB](https://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=73116)
